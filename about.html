			<p> This is my about page. I will enventually go into depth about the different things that can be done to create a successful garden.
			There are many ways to create a successful garden and I will be showing the way I have found works for me.
			Everybody is different and everyone will garden differently. </p>
			
			<p>This assignment was very difficult for me, I am by no means a HTML wizard and not the most creative. I know this will get easier in time, 
			but for now I will have to keep things simple and continue to move forward. 
			For V2 I had an easier time and polished up my pages and added a new one.</p>
			
			<p> I am happy to finish this assignment and to add a new page. I added the Mailing List page to finish off everything that was needed for V3.
			I have learned quite a bit about web developement and realize I will not be specializing in it. This class was a good experience and I am glad I know 
			more about HTML.</p>
